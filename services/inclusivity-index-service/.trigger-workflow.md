# Trigger Workflow

This workflow is triggered by a push to the main branch of the microservice.  
It runs the following jobs:

- **Test:** Executes unit and integration tests for the service.  
- **Build and Deploy:** Builds the Docker image and deploys the service to the configured Kubernetes cluster.  

Use this workflow to verify that changes pass tests and are correctly deployed.
