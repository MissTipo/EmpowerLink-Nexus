# Trigger workflow
# This workflow is triggered by a push to the main branch
# It runs the `build` job, which builds the project and runs tests
# It also runs the `deploy` job, which deploys the project to production
# The `deploy` job is only run if the `build` job is successful
# The `deploy` job is only run if the `GITHUB_REF` environment variable is set to `refs/heads/main`
